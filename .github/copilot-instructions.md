# Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Source Control

- We use GitHub Issues for all work tracking.
- We use Pull Requests to facilitate code reviews.
- We use Trunk-based development and short term feature branches. Featur branches should start with `feat/`, for example a feature called "add login" would be `feat/add-login`.
