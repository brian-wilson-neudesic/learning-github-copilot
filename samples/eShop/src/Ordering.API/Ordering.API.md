# Ordering.API Documentation

## Overview

The `Ordering.API` project is part of the eShop sample application and is designed to manage order-related operations. This API provides versioned endpoints to facilitate the ordering process in a scalable and maintainable manner. It integrates essential middleware for error handling, service defaults, and OpenAPI documentation generation.

## Key Features

- **Service Defaults and Application Services**:  
  The API initializes with a set of predefined service defaults and application-specific services, ensuring consistency across the platform.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Incorporates problem details middleware to provide standardized error responses to API consumers.

- **API Versioning**:  
  The API is versioned to allow smooth transitions and backward compatibility. The current implementation creates a versioned API for "Orders", ensuring that changes do not impact existing clients unexpectedly.

- **OpenAPI Documentation**:  
  Automatically generates OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation. This makes it easier for developers and business analysts to understand the APIâ€™s capabilities and facilitates easier integration for third-party systems.

- **Authorization**:  
  The `orders` endpoint is secured and requires proper authorization for access, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests can place or query orders.

## Architecture Details

The main setup for the API is defined in [Program.cs](samples/eShop/src/Ordering.API/Program.cs). The following are the prominent configurations:

1. **Builder Initialization**:  
   Creates a web application builder and configures necessary defaults and services.

2. **Service Configuration**:  
   - Registers service defaults.
   - Registers application-specific services.
   - Adds problem details support to handle errors uniformly.
   - Configures API versioning.

3. **API Configuration and Endpoints**:  
   - Configures default OpenAPI documentation.
   - Defines versioned endpoints using `NewVersionedApi("Orders")`.
   - Maps the orders API (version 1) and applies authorization requirements.
   - Sets up default endpoints and ensures they adhere to the OpenAPI configuration.

## Dependencies

- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.ProblemDetails for error handling.
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning for API versioning.
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore for OpenAPI documentation generation.

## Business Relevance

- **Streamlined Order Management**:  
  The API lays the foundation for order processing in the eShop ecosystem, providing essential operations for managing orders.

- **Future-Proof API Design**:  
  With built-in support for versioning and standard error handling, the API is well prepared to accommodate future enhancements without disrupting existing functionalities.

- **Enhanced Integrations**:  
  Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation simplifies integrations with third-party systems and internal services, making it easier for business analysts to understand and relay implementation requirements.

This documentation should serve as a high-level technical guide for business analysts to understand the scope, design, and integration points of the `Ordering.API` project.
